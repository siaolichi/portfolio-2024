A little patch of grass by the telephone pole in front of our house.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing else there, just this one particularly tall plant. Since it's right under the telephone pole, I couldn't help but wonder how many little dogs might have pee on it. The thought of it made me hesitate to touch it directly with my hands—how embarrassing!

A little sprout growing out of the stone wall next to our house!<br/>

It’s in such a conspicuous spot, right at my eye level. Its boldness made it an easy target for someone like me, who loves picking plants.`,

Stinging Nettle on the Streets of Berlin.<br/>

In March, most plants in Berlin are still hibernating. The roadsides are only dotted with sparse weeds, but the stinging nettle near our house is particularly lush.<br/>

I didn't actually know it was stinging nettle because, growing up in the city, I never had much interest in plants. But since the whole plant was covered in thorns, I was extra careful when picking it. Even so, I ended up with a tiny prick that made my finger hurt all day.`,

Don't doubt it—when I first saw it, it was just a bud.><br/>

After bringing it home and subjecting it to two hours of intense flash lighting, the chrysanthemum surprisingly bloomed vigorously! It sounds romantic, but after each round of scanning, I noticed it looked different from before, meaning I had to start all over again. This feeling was far from romantic.`,

A little daisy picked in the middle of the night at a campsite in the outskirts of Bordeaux. It might have been too tiny, as when I scanned it, it looked just like a small piece of clay.`,

As soon as I arrived in the Algarve region of Portugal, the roadsides were filled with these little yellow flowers. At first glance, I thought of the yellow morning glories in Keigo Higashino's novels, and I even checked to see if morning glories could be yellow. It turns out they don't exist in that color.`,

Today, a sudden gust of wind hit. The weather forecast says it will rain all week starting tomorrow. The ground was once covered with blooming little white flowers, now less than half remain due to the wind.<br/>

I hurriedly picked an undamaged little white flower and took it back to the car to scan. In the three-minute walk, the petals must have tumbled countless times, yet when I reached the car, the flower was still perfectly intact.`,

The beaches of Portugal have always been filled with similar root-like plants. Every time I visit, it's either desolate or overrun with vines. This time, I happened to stop by at the end of the rainy season and was lucky enough to see them in bloom. I never expected their flowers to be such a vibrant purple!`,

For some reason, purple flowers always bloom the latest and the least. While the yellow and white flowers have already bloomed in clusters and are starting to wither, the purple flowers are just now making their appearance. The only small cluster of purple flowers at the campsite bloomed two days ago, and their purple and white colors look so cute!`,

Before I could upload the photos to my computer, my camera got stolen. So today's big red flower is only captured in scanned images. <br/>

In mid-April, amidst the sudden heatwave in Andalusia, this big red flower bloomed boldly and brightly. It looks like it was meticulously planted, but in reality, it stands out starkly amidst a pile of weeds.

Plants throughout Venice are unusually scarce, and naturally growing wildflowers and weeds are even scarcer. While the camping area is adorned with a variety of flowers, most are cultivated by diligent staff, leaving little room for wildflowers and weeds to flourish. Fortunately, I finally discovered this overlooked gem under the tree!

Pampas grass is everywhere, growing thick and lush along the roadsides. Every time I see them, I think of my cat daughter eagerly waiting for me at home.<br/>

I wonder if she would enjoy playing with pampas grass?`,

Salzburg was once the residence of archbishops during the Middle Ages, rich with a strong religious (and gossipy) atmosphere. It wasn't until Mozart's birth that it transformed into the capital of music.<br/>

This campsite is overgrown with various wild grasses, so dense that it left me extremely frustrated, not knowing which card to flip. Suddenly, I spotted this little gentleman, and decided he was the one!`,
