    title: "《In Progress》Audiovisual Performance  made by UE5/Ableton Live/Manus Gloves",
    description: `In Progress is an interactive audiovisual installation that explores the transformation of hand gestures into sound and real-time visuals. The work is built around motion-tracking gloves, which function as the primary interface between the performer’s body and a computational system. Subtle movements of the fingers and wrists—such as bending, rotating, or pausing—are continuously captured and translated into audiovisual responses, forming a sensitive feedback loop between physical action and digital processes.
    <br/>
    Rather than presenting a fixed composition, In Progress emphasizes openness, gradual change, and ongoing development. The installation operates as an evolving system in which gestures do not trigger predefined events, but instead modulate parameters within a generative audiovisual environment. Sound and image respond fluidly to bodily movement, allowing the work to shift over time and adapt to different spatial and temporal contexts. Each activation of the system produces a slightly different outcome, shaped by the performer’s presence and the conditions of the exhibition space.
    <br/>
    In an installation setting, the work can function either as a live-activated piece—performed by the artist at scheduled times—or as a semi-autonomous system that responds to slow, minimal gestures. The visuals are generated in real time and projected into the space, creating a continuously transforming environment. The sound ranges from subtle textures to more dynamic structures, depending on the intensity and frequency of the gestures. Together, these elements create an immersive field in which movement, perception, and digital feedback coexist.
    <br/>
    The title In Progress reflects both the technical state of the project and its conceptual framework. The work is intentionally designed to remain unfinished, allowing new mappings, behaviors, and audiovisual relationships to emerge through continuous experimentation. Rather than aiming toward a final, fixed form, the project embraces iteration, accumulation, and responsiveness as its core methodology. This approach mirrors the artist’s interest in systems that evolve through use, repetition, and attentive interaction.
    <br/>
    In Progress is adaptable to a variety of exhibition environments, including black box spaces, galleries, and hybrid formats between installation and performance. The system is self-contained and does not require internet access. By foregrounding the body as a sensitive interface and emphasizing real-time feedback, the work invites viewers to observe how minimal human gestures can gradually shape complex audiovisual structures over time.`,

    title: "Resonance of the Virtual",
    description: `The installation is based on a regular dodecahedron, creating a miniature cosmos where I become the center of this resonance. Wires connect various parts of my body to the dodecahedron. Through the arrangement and combination of these wires on the dodecahedron, I project diverse images of the virtual world within it. The multifaceted container simultaneously symbolizes my virtual identities in the online world.<br/>
The work delves into the integration of virtual and real, particularly showcasing the diversity of virtual identities through the variations in wire arrangements. This symbolizes the intricate interaction between virtual reality and real life, and the impact of technology on the shaping of individual identities.<br/>
The arrangement of wires not only changes the projection of the virtual world but also deeply reflects the complexity of constructing virtual identities online. The constant transformation of these wires represents the dynamic changes of our virtual presence in the digital space.<br/>
Although the projections in the virtual world are digital, our increasing reliance on the internet and technology makes this virtuality tend towards reality. However, this does not replace the existence of reality but rather coexists as a parallel world, where we simultaneously exhibit multiple facets.`,

      "In the tea ceremony, the tea maker relies on hands to perform the tea brewing process. Each subtle hand movement is carefully thought out. In this work, I placed six-axis sensors on the hands of the performing artist and then converted the artist's hand movements into sounds to create this improvisational sound performance.",
